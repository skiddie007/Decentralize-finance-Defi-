# Decentralized Finance
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a blockchain-based financial system that eliminates intermediaries like banks, enabling peer-to-peer transactions and access to financial services such as lending, borrowing, and trading. 
It leverages smart contracts for transparency, security, and automation, offering global access and reducing costs compared to traditional finance.
